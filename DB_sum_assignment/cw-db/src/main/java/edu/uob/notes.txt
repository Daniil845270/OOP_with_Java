- Both Database names and Table names should be case-insensitive (since some file systems have problems differentiating between upper and lower case filenames)
use tolower when the need arises


what to do:
- create directory, use directory and create a file are (mostly) ready
- SELECT " <WildAttribList> " FROM " [TableName] | "SELECT " <WildAttribList> " FROM " [TableName] " WHERE " <Condition>


insert: check if the file exists adn the database is selected in the command handler, not in the parser
for (String token : tokens.subList(5, tokensNum - 2)) {  // there may not be any attributes, but that's fine for now
if the table name has an extension in it, I probably should trim it
if (!currInMemDatabase.containsTable(tableName + ".tab")) { // this may be a bad way to handle the problem of names having/not having extension
when I write to files check that the files are writable
when I read from files, check that they are readable
